Excerpt:

Here is a function from the contract:

[https://www.formie.co/form/25IlKwgfMEGBy4ePdSjQ](https://www.formie.co/form/25IlKwgfMEGBy4ePdSjQ) (you can use this site to create interfaces to contracts, but you are better off using Remix or Tenderly or, really, just simulating everything, don't waste your ETH on failed txs)

...takes the following parameters:

`Wot Wurdz (bytes32)`

`How Manyyy (unit256)`

Check [plausible-answer-1.txt](snippets/plausible-answer-1.txt) for a plausible answer.

Check the transactions logs:

[https://etherscan.io/txsInternal?a=0xae5103e2c1bbc487832ebb4820844c8a72f755e2&m=advanced](https://etherscan.io/txsInternal?a=0xae5103e2c1bbc487832ebb4820844c8a72f755e2&m=advanced)

These are the internal transactions logs
Use a better solution though, such as Tenderly, or ... I can't think about another right this second lol.
